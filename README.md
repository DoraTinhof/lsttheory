lsttheory
=========

This \textsf{R} package is a supplement for the article 'A Theory of States and Traits -- Revised' (SMGC; Steyer, Mayer, Geiser, \& Cole, in press). It is based on the structural equation modeling \textsf{R} package \texttt{lavaan} (Rosseel, 2012) and provides a convenient interface to compute some common models of the revised latent state-trait theory (LST-R theory). The main function of the package lsttheory() allows for easy specification of multistate, multistate-singletrait, and multistate-multitrait models. It automatically generates \texttt{lavaan} syntax for these models, runs the models, and returns model estimates together with reliability, occasion specificity, and consistency coefficients for the respective models. Please see the vignette for details.
